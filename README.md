i3Plus+ is a version of [Marlin](https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Marlin) with modifications to work with the Wanhao Duplicator i3+ and its family of rebrandings (PowerSpec Duplicator, Cacoon Create, Monoprice Maker Select, etc.). This includes both a new firmware for the LCD and a modified version of Marlin that has been updated with some custom code to accomedate the touch screen and add some printer specific features.
